Poster 1: "Double Articulation in AI and Machine Learning"
Purpose:

Introduce first-year computer science students to "double articulation," exploring how data is structured at two levels for effective AI tasks.
Articulations:

High-Level Data Structuring:

    Prepares data for machine learning.
    Includes preprocessing and feature engineering.
    Examples: Text tokenization, stemming, bag-of-words for text; resizing, normalization for images.

Low-Level Data Structuring:

    Represents data for machine processing.
    Involves numerical representations, matrices, tensors, or binary data.
    Examples: One-hot encoding, word embeddings for NLP; pixel values as numerical arrays in images.

Connection:

    Facilitates data transition from human-readable to machine-readable forms.
    Enables efficient use of data in machine learning tasks.
