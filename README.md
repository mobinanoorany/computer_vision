Poster 1: "Double Articulation in AI and Machine Learning"
Purpose:

Introduce first-year computer science students to "double articulation," exploring how data is structured at two levels for effective AI tasks.
Articulations:

High-Level Data Structuring:

    Prepares data for machine learning.
    Includes preprocessing and feature engineering.
    Examples: Text tokenization, stemming, bag-of-words for text; resizing, normalization for images.

Low-Level Data Structuring:

    Represents data for machine processing.
    Involves numerical representations, matrices, tensors, or binary data.
    Examples: One-hot encoding, word embeddings for NLP; pixel values as numerical arrays in images.

Connection:

    Facilitates data transition from human-readable to machine-readable forms.
    Enables efficient use of data in machine learning tasks.
    
2: "Maps and Models in Computer Science"
Purpose:

Introduce first-year computer science students to "maps" and "models," building a foundational understanding of data structures and machine learning.
Part 1: Maps

    Explore data types: images or numerical.
    Learn data structure for machine learning.
    Perform Python operations on dictionaries.
    Write a Python function for mapping numerical data.
    Understand pixel-wise maps for image representation.

Part 2: Models (Machine Learning):

    Choose image classification problem (e.g., Flower Recognition or MNIST).
    Use machine learning library (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
    Build, train, and describe a CNN model.
    Apply model to classify images.

 3: "Entropy and Negentropy in Information Theory and AI"
Purpose:

Introduce students to entropy and negentropy in information theory, showcasing their applications in AI.
Task:

    Apply entropy and negentropy to feature selection and data preprocessing in machine learning.
    Demonstrate in a specific AI application (e.g., spam email classification, sentiment analysis).

Entropy:

    Measure of uncertainty or disorder.
    Used in decision trees and classification.
    Application in natural language processing for text classification.

Negentropy:

    Measures structured information.
    Applied in feature selection for pattern recognition.
    Used in image analysis for identifying regular patterns.
